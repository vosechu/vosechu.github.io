<h3>Welcome to Chuck Lauer Vose's Github homepage.</h3>

<p>This page is here as an example of using Github pages. We're using Github pages at the <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School</a> to spruce up our developer resumes and make it obvious which repos to look at and what code we're particularly proud of.</p>

<p>If you would like to check out this code please look follow these steps:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/vosechu/vosechu.github.com.git
$ cd vosechu.github.com
$ git log
</code></pre>
