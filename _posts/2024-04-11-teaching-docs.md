## Summary

Making educational content is really, really hard. Split the task into two parts:
1. Documentation for current practitioners and experts
1. Documentation meant for newcomers to the field

My suggestion is to **start with writing the doc that _you_ will need in 6 months**. You know, after you've forgotten most of this stuff. Include things like how you tweak your port settings or that extra script that you don't have checked in or how you made your `.env` file. It will bitrot, don't worry about it.

Only after getting that down, **then start on docs that provide newcomers enough context to read the other doc**.

Trying to make docs that do both requires tremendous skill. Normally what happens is that newcomers can't follow it, and current practitioners are annoyed by the simplifications.

## The non-bite-sized version

TODO: Find and include link to original article
TODO: Decide what else to say. Maybe the above is enough.
